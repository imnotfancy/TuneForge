Stem separation has long been a fascination in the audio world, with the end goal of splitting a mixed track into separate parts without any noticeable glitches or audio artefacts. A few years ago, it felt like the stuff of science fiction, but more powerful computers and access to machine learning datasets have turned it into a reality that’s only getting better.

As each year progresses, there seem to be improvements in both separation quality and in the number of specific instruments that the [AI](https://musictech.com/tag/ai/) can isolate. But which one is best for you?

## Which is the best stem separation software?

We’ve picked 9 coveted tools to test, from [LANDR](https://musictech.com/brands/landr/) and [Apple](https://musictech.com/brands/apple/)’s [Logic Pro](https://musictech.com/tag/apple-logic-pro/) to [Lalal.ai](https://musictech.com/brands/lalal-ai/) and Gaudio Studio. To find out which gives the cleanest sounding results, we’re using the track _Burn For You_ by Notize (courtesy of [artlist.io](http://artlist.io/)), and splitting the stereo track into individual component parts.

## How we test the stem separation tools

In all cases, each software’s highest-quality configurations were chosen. These examples should give you a rough idea of the stemming quality, but the results _can_ vary from track to track. It’s possible that one algorithm may perform slightly better than another when fed a certain audio, but the results could be reversed with a different track.

Here’s a list of things to try and listen out for when comparing the results:

- Do any other instruments leak between stems at any point?
- Are there any timbral changes? Does the algorithm get confused with other instruments and take some information away?
- Are natural [reverb](https://musictech.com/tag/reverb/) tails included?
- How does it handle backing [vocals](https://musictech.com/tag/vocals/)?
- Are there any additional artefacts like metallic whistles, glitches, hiss or phasing issues?

## Which stem separation software is the best?

After carefully analysing the vocals, drums, [bass](https://musictech.com/tag/bass/) and other instrument stems, and cross-referencing with a few other examples, we found the results quite surprising.

We’d like to say there’s a definitive answer as to which one sounds best, but the truth is there are variations from track to track and some are better at certain instruments than others. At this level, all of these tools generally sound pretty decent and relatively clean. If stem separation is something that you do often, then it may be worth having access to more than one service so that you can experiment to get the best results for your material. Moving forward, we plan on using Logic’s built-in separation for most musical parts due to it’s ease of use, and then testing the more critical vocal separation with Lalal.ai and Gaudio Studio, as these have a token system so we can avoid a subscription.

If I had to choose our top three for vocals, then it would probably be Lalal.ai, Gaudio Studio, and AudioStrip. These give the smoothest sounding vocals with consistent top-end and clean reverb tails. If you’re willing to put the time into experimenting with the various models, then you can probably get equal or better results with the free [UVR5](https://musictech.com/products/ultimate-vocal-remover-5-software/).

The variation in the drums can sometimes be so large that it’s pretty much down to personal preference as to which one works best with what you’re doing. Some services excluded certain percussive sounds, but this actually resulted in a more stable and arguably usable drum stem.

Logic Pro, [Moises](https://musictech.com/brands/moises/) and Lalal.ai are better-suited for live bass guitar separation with slightly brighter and more defined transients.

The so-called Other category is a mixed bag, as many contain a slightly unstable blend of extra parts from other stems. Lots of these services are starting to offer separations for more and more specific instruments (like acoustic guitar, [wind](https://musictech.com/tag/brass-winds/), [strings](https://musictech.com/tag/strings/), etc), but just be aware that the smaller the separation, the more difficult the extraction. Surprisingly, Logic Pro excelled with its new [piano](https://musictech.com/tag/pianos/) algorithm, and Gaudio Studio did well with piano but quite badly with electric guitar.

What do you think? Have a listen to the files and see which you think sounds best. Each option has different pros and cons, including processing speed, price and workflow, so the final decision isn’t necessarily black and white. Different tracks could result in a different leaderboard. Whichever one you go for, we can all agree at least that the technology is mind-blowing — and it’s only going to get better.

Note that you should always respect the copyright of any original material you use these tools on. Also, some of these tools will process the audio using their own servers, so an internet connection is required, and the waiting times can vary.

## Stem separation software available in 2025

### LANDR

LANDR started as an online [mastering](https://musictech.com/tag/mastering/) service, but has grown into a full suite of tools and resources for music creation, [production](https://musictech.com/tag/production/) and distribution.

[RipX DAW](https://musictech.com/reviews/digital-audio-workstations/hitnmix-ripx-daw-review/) and RipX DAW Pro are based on the unique Rip Audio format, which deconstructs audio down to its individual elements and treats audio and MIDI as one. You can split audio into stems for voice, drums + [percussion](https://musictech.com/tag/percussion/), bass, other sounds + instruments, and [guitar](https://musictech.com/tag/guitars/) \+ piano. The beauty here, though, is that you can further refine the detection to get the best results, and even edit the harmonic and unpitched elements separately.

Other features include [Melodyne](https://musictech.com/brands/melodyne/)-style note editing, the ability to change and randomise the key or generate new harmonies, adding [effects](https://musictech.com/tag/effects/) to individual notes, replacing any note with a different sampled instrument, advanced repair and cleanup, and more.

Lalal comes as both a web-based and desktop/mobile [app](https://musictech.com/tag/apps/) stem separator. You can try several files for free, or choose from a range of one-off fees that get you a set number of processing minutes. This is a great alternative to monthly payment plans if you think you’ll only occasionally want to use the service.

The latest version is based on a state-of-the-art, in-house developed neural network called Perseus, which advances transformer models to recreate stems with more nuanced harmonics and tonal qualities. Currently, you can extract a large list of instruments, including vocal and backing vocal separation, strings, wind and acoustic or electric guitars.

Lalal has also added a Voice Cleaner, De-Echo and Noise Cancelling options, plus an Enhanced Processing feature that lets you choose between reduced instrument cross-bleed, or more intricate detail in your separations.

Price: Free, £84 yearly, or £10 per month subscription, or £42 for 750 minutes (other options also available)

Web-based, plus desktop iOS and Android apps

### AudioStrip

![AudioStrip, photo by MusicTech](https://musictech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/AudioStrip-credit-MusicTech@1400x1050.jpg)AudioStrip. Image: MusicTech

AudioStrip is a high-quality online option that uses the results of both the MDX-Net and Demucs libraries. The company also notes on its website that the algorithms will be updated as and when new methods come out.

When you upload a file, you can choose from three different algorithms, and then separate out to vocals, instrumental, bass, drums, other, piano and guitar.

You can choose from a basic free option that includes 3 isolations, 3 masters, and 3 transcripts per month, with a slower isolation speed, limited file size and MP3 output format. Or alternatively, the Premium option gives you unlimited uploads, faster isolation, larger files, WAV, FLAC and MP3 formats and batch uploads.

Price: Free / $7.77pm Premium

Online

Stems: Vocals, Instrumental, Bass, Drums (with separates), Other, Piano and Guitar, background vocals

### Apple Logic Pro 11.2

![Apple Logic Pro 11.2.](https://musictech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/logic-pro-11.2-hero@2000x1500.jpg)Apple Logic Pro 11.2. Image: Apple

Apple added stem separation to Logic about a year ago, and it was pretty decent. The latest 11.2 update brings improved audio quality, plus the ability to separate piano and guitar. You can right-click on any audio region and then choose which stems or collection of stems you want. It’s a feature that uses the grunt of the Apple Silicon chips, so it’s only available for more recent computers. However, the offshoot is that it’s incredibly fast to process.

As Apple is always incredibly tight-lipped about what goes on behind the scenes, it’s unlikely we’ll ever find out exactly what models and libraries they’ve been using. The ease and speed of having it built into the DAW workflow cannot be understated, though.

Price: $199 (Stem separation requires Apple Silicon chips)

Standalone DAW

Stems: Vocals, Drums, Bass, Instruments, Guitar, Piano

### Ultimate Vocal Remover 5

![Ultimate Vocal Remover 5, photo by MusicTech](https://musictech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ultimate-Vocal-Remover-5-credit-MusicTech@1400x1050.jpg)Ultimate Vocal Remover 5. Image: MusicTech

If you want to delve deep into using a range of different models, then you might want to check out the free Ultimate Vocal Remover 5. With this standalone program, you can choose from a wide range of free algorithms, with more downloadable as they become available. You can even use an Ensemble mode to run your audio through two models to get improved results.

The only downside is that it’s not very user-friendly, and the processing can take quite a long time with certain settings. It’s also a little overwhelming as it’s not obvious which settings will yield the best results, although you can check mvsep.com for separation quality leaderboards of results from other users.

Price: Free

Standalone

Stems: Vocals, Bass, Drums, Other
